# 👋 About Me
Hi, I'm Jon! I'm an graduate researcher at Carnegie Mellon studying Automated Science. In my spare time, I enjoy pursuing computer science as a hobby. I have experience with Python, Go, MATLAB, and TensorFlow.

# 🌱 Current Projects
Here are some of the projects I am currently working on:

- **Codex:** A software package compatible with a variety of liquid handlers for designing and strategizing optimal paths and labware patterns.
- **D&DAV:** An audio-visual dashboard for my D&D games, written in Python and using obsidian.md as a renderer.
- **DiceCloud:** An open-source, real-time character sheet for D&D 5e, written in Vue and JavaScript.


# 🌲Past Projects
- **BRCA-s:** A capstone to my foray into Machine Learning, this uses a variety of ML methods (Such as PCA, K-means, Logistic Regression with L1/Lasso penalty, Random Forests) to find which differntially expressed genes are most significant when subtyping breast cancer. Employed cross-validation and hyperparameter optimization with GridSearch.
- **MSAL:** An Active Learning framework for training a NN surrogate model to MASSIF, a powerful but slow algorithm that finds the stress and strain fields of pourous materials. Uses Monte-Carlo dropout and COVDROP as measures of uncertainty, and a novel selection heuristic called USP that balances exploitation of model uncertainty with data structure.
- **DegranQuant:** A machine learning model to count activated granules in neutrophils, written in Python using TensorFlow and numpy.
- **HYDRO:** A closed-loop automated hydroponics system that balances ions in a nutrient maintank.
- **Ten:** A tetherless fluid handling robot for performing microbiology and molecular genetics experiments.
