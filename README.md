# 👋 About Me
Hi, I'm Jon! I'm an graduate researcher at Carnegie Mellon studying Automated Science. In my spare time, I enjoy pursuing computer science as a hobby. I have experience with Python, Go, MATLAB, and TensorFlow.

# 🌱 Current Projects
Here are some of the projects I am currently working on:

- **D&DAV:** An audio-visual dashboard for my D&D games, written in Python and using obsidian.md as a renderer.
- **DegranQuant:** A machine learning model to count activated granules in neutrophils, written in Python using TensorFlow and numpy.
- **Dicecloud:** An open-source, real-time character sheet for D&D 5e, written in Vue and JavaScript.
- **HYDRO:** A closed-loop automated hydroponics system that balances ions in a nutrient maintank.
- **Ten:** A tetherless fluid handling robot for performing microbiology and molecular genetics experiments.
