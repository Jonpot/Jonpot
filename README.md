# ðŸ‘‹ About Me
Hi, I'm Jon! I'm an undergraduate researcher at UC Davis, studying Biosystems Engineering and Microbiology and Molecular Genetics. In my spare time, I enjoy pursuing computer science as a hobby. I have experience with Python, MATLAB, and TensorFlow, and I am currently a TA for the Intro to Python class at UC Davis.

# ðŸŒ± Current Projects
Here are some of the projects I am currently working on:

- **D&DAV:** An audio-visual dashboard for my D&D games, written in Python and using obsidian.md as a renderer.
- **DegranQuant:** A machine learning model to count activated granules in neutrophils, written in Python using TensorFlow and numpy.
- **Dicecloud:** An open-source, real-time character sheet for D&D 5e, written in Vue and JavaScript.
